# minted-api-rust
Minted API backend implementation using Rust (WIP)

## Installation

This project uses the nightly version of Rust. To install Rust nightly, follow these steps:

1. Install `rustup`, a toolchain installer for Rust. If you already have `rustup` installed, you can skip this step. To install `rustup`, open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
   This will download a script and start the installation. You may be prompted for your password.

2. Once `rustup` is installed, you can install Rust nightly by running:
   ```bash
   rustup install nightly
   ```

3. To use Rust nightly for this project only, navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   rustup override set nightly
   ```
   This sets the nightly toolchain as the override for the current directory, meaning Rust nightly will be used for this project only.

You should now have Rust nightly installed for this project.

## Building and Running the Project

To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
This command will compile all the source code files and generate an executable file.

To run the project, in the project directory, use the following command:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
This command will run the executable file generated by `cargo build`.

Please note that any changes made to the source code will require you to re-run `cargo build` before running the project with `cargo run`.
